What is Facebook Prophet ?

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

Prophet has the below features:
- It is fast and accurate: I have no doubts about the speed and optimality of this forecast procedure but accuracy needs more debate and investigation.
- Fully automated: I really like how you simply can use the Prophet because lots of things are automatic.
- Tunable forecasts: It gives you possibilities to tune your model/procedure.
- Availability in R and Python which are two majorly chosen languages for data scientists.


Automating the forecasting process in such a way that you will get the forecast of any of your favourite stock with all necessary visualization within a few seconds of uploading the data.
